Script able to set up a second monitor and a second keyboard

Scenario:
- Display running at 1360x768
- Second monitor display, awaiting on VGA or HDMI
- Second keyboard
- Fluxbox, XFCE or any other Window Manager without control panel
- Stupid control panel on Unity, Gnome, KDE or fat WM, unable to put adequately 1920x1080, 1024x768, etc

This stupid script let choose quickly a double moitor + keyboard configuration
